Strict Antecedent Basis: Introduction
============

Strict Antecedent Basis and compilable claims.

## Introduction

> "It is of utmost importance that patents issue with definite claims that clearly and precisely inform persons skilled in the art of the boundaries of protected subject matter."

[MPEP 2173](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2173.html); see 35 U.S.C ยง 112(b). Unfortunately, the English language is too flexible and too complicated for many people to write a clear claim.

Strict Antecedent Basis is a standard that eliminates many ambiguities. Strict Antecedent Basis rules are tailored to draft claims that clearly meet the standards of the USPTO and US law. A claim may still be valid and clear without adhering to Strict Antecedent Basis.

Definite claims do not mean narrow claims, and indefinite or ambiguous claims do not mean broad claims. A good patent practitioner drafts claims that are both definite and broad. 

A court can just as easily construe an ambiguous term narrowly instead of broadly. I would prefer to stand confidently in court knowing that an infringer is clearly infringing my patent rather than hoping that I fall ass-backwards into good fortune with a court that construes my claims broadly enough for me stop, or collect a royalty from, the infringer. Furthermore, requiring a court to construe ambiguous claims can increase the cost of litigation or worse -- invalidate my patent.

The following posts define the Strict Antecedent Basis rules and provide numerous examples. I will update posts and add new posts over time.
