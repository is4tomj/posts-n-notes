Transfer representation for a case before the USPTO
=========

How you transfer a case depends on whether the case is a pending application, an issued patent, or a PCT Application. Each of these cases is discussed below.

## Pending or Provisional Applications

For a pending U.S. Patent Application or a provisional application (pending or expired), filed on or after September 16, 2012, where the assignee-applicant was named as the applicant when the application was filed, use [this form \(PTO/AIA/82\)](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/forms/aia0082.pdf).

This form has Parts A, B, and C. Part C is only useful if the transferring attorney is not using a customer number, so I'm going to ignore Part C.

Part A has fields that identify the application being transferred and includes application specific data, such as an Application Number. Accordingly, Part A is different for each patent application you are transferring.

Part B identifies the assignee-applicant and requires the client's signature. A client can sign Part B once, and a copy of Part B can be attached to a copy of Part A for each patent application.

## Issued Applications

For an issued U.S. Patent, filed on or after September 16, 2012, you must file two forms: [POA for issued patents \(PTO/AIA/81a\)] (https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/aia0081a.pdf) and a [37 CRF 3.73\(c\) Statement \(PTO/AIA/96\)](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/forms/aia0096.pdf) Statement.  If a 37 CRF 3.73\(c\) Statement has already been filed, then you can simply identify the 3.73\(c\) Statement; otherwise, a 3.73\(c\) Statement can be drafted and filed with the POA.


## PCT Applications

Appointment of an agent for a PCT, filed on or after September 16, 2012, may be effected by referring, in a request, demand, or separate notice, to an existing separate POA appointing that agent to represent the applicant. See [MPEP 9025](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e377280).

[MPEP 9025](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e377231).

I am planning to file a POA using [PTO/AIA/80](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/forms/aia0080.pdf) with Parts A and B, which are the same parts that were used to transfer a pending application.  I will also file
