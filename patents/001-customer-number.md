Register and use a New Customer Number with the USPTO
====================

I’m not going to go into why registering a customer number is important. I’m only going show the fastest way to create one and when to use it:

0. Go to Private Pair;
0. Search in the page for “PAIR Administration” and expand that region;
0. Select “Create New Customer Number” and “Continue”;
0. Fill out the form;
0. Select “Preview”; and
0. Select “Submit”.

Although the status will show “Submitted”, I was able to start using the new Customer Number right away. I was also able to edit my the Customer Number to add another attorney’s registration number.
