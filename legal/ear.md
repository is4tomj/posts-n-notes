Encryption and Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
==========

Refernces to `EAR` or `EAR part` are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. [EAR ยง 740.1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/15/740.1) provides an introduction.

## Definitions

`Encryption Items ("EI")` are items that are included in the classifications listed in EAR part 742.15. An EI may require a license to export or reexport depending on the EI's classification. Example classifications that require a license are 

`Restricted Items` are items that cannot be sold to non-U.S. government customer without a license. Sales can be authorized for export to non-government (commercial) consumers outside of the customers in countries listed in group D1 (Countries under embargo or a U.N. sanction). See EAR part 740.17(b)(2).

`Unrestricted Items` are items that can be authorized to sell to government and non-government entities. See EAR part 740.17(b)(3).

`Self-classifiable Items` are items that can be to a non-U.S. government customer or a commercial customer without waiting for authorization. No license is required. See EAR part 740.17(b)(1).

`Non-standard encryption` is secret encryption, or encryption that is used, but the details of how the encryption/decryption work are publically available.

## Steps

1. Sign up for [SNAP-R](https://snapr.bis.doc.gov/snapr/) for the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which is the portal to register a company, file self-classifications, or licenses. This can take a few days to finalize.
2. File Company Registration with Encryption Registration Number. A lot of encryption reviews are a waste time because people failed to register first.
3. Submit encryption review or exception.

## License Exception TSU
This is the easiest, but many people might not qualify for the exception. The required notifications are discribed in 740.13(e), which is simply to send an email to crypt@bis.doc.gov and enc@nsa.gov.

## License Exception ENC
- Restricted itmes (740.17(b)(2)): Sales to non-U.S. government customers require a license, but can be authorized for export to non-government (commerical) consumers outside of customers outside of country group D1 (Countries under embargo or a U.N. sanction). Must wait for authorization before selling to commerical consumers.
- Unrestricted items (740.17(b)(3)): Sales are authorized to government and non-government entities, but still need to wait for authorization.
- Self-classifiable items (740.17(b)(1)): If a company can use this, then there is no need to wait for any authorization before shipping a product out of the U.S. However, the self-classification should still be filed beforehand. This method needs to be resubmitted every year.

## Mass Market Review

The details are in EAR part 742.15(b). There are several qualification. On qualification is that the product must be "generally available to the public by being sold without restriction, from stock at retail selling points". For example, a product that is sold to a handful of customer each quarter is probably not going to qualify for Mass Market Review.


## Classification and Self-classification

Classification is required for `Restricted Items` and `Non-Restricted Items`. See 740.17(b)(2) and (3) and 742.15(b)(3). Examples of these items frequently include network infrastructure items, such as routers, VPNs, appliances. Firewalls are not generally included in this group unless those firewalls include encryption functionality. This group does not include the items that are sold at best buy.

Self-classification is allowed for "other" items, such as `Self-Classifiable Items`. See 740.17(b)(1) and 742.15(b)(1).
