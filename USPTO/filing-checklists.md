EFS Filings with the USPTO

## US Provisional Patent Application

### Required

1. Specification,
2. Drawings,
3. Fee, and
4. Provisional Cover Sheet (SB16).

### Optional, but recommended

1. Assignment,
2. 373(c) statement, and
3. ADS.

You can avoid a lot of pain if you just file all required and optional documents at the same time.

### Identifying the Applicant matters

If you file a PCT that claims priority to a provisional application, then the Applicant (usually corporation) must be identified. The assignments for the PCT or the priority application, need to be signed when the PCT is filed. As a safety measure, at least identify the applicant every application.

If you do not file an ADS, then the inventors will be listed as the Applicant in Private Pair. You can file an assignment and a 373(c) Statement. See 62/429,710 and 62/429,717. **I'm not sure this is actually necessary: note that HP only files Spec, Drawings, Fee, Coversheet, but does not file ADS, 373(c), or POA. See 62,306,022.**


## US Non-Provisional Patent Application

Priority/benefit claims must be in the ADS unless pre-AIA. Priority/benefit claims may also be the application. I like to include statements in the Priority/benfit claims in the application that I will include later.

> With regard to this  application, Applicant(s) rescind any disclaimer of claim scope or prosecution history of any parent or other related application(s); furthermore, the claims in this application may be broader than any claims in any parent or other related application(s).
