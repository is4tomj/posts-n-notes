Export Control
==========


## Send a product to China or Non-U.S. customer

A product of a U.S. company can fall under ECCN5A992 for export control purposes, based on a filing with the Commerce Department. Products with that designation do not require a license to export to China. However, when sending any products to *any non-U.S. customer*, run a check with the U.S. Government's consolidate denied persons and sanctions database to make sure that the particular individual is not off limits. To send the product to a Chinese customer/company, check for the the name and address of the Chinese company -- not each individual running the Chinese company or employees of the Chinese company. No check is required to send the product to China for use by the U.S. company's employee or contractor within China (i.e., the U.S. company is not losing control of the boxes).
